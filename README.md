# digitalFootprint
As our digital identity grows, so does our need for mindfulness. Project Digital Footprint helps users control their online presence in three stages: mapping, managing, and maintaining. Whether for employment, security, or curiosity, Digital Footprint
            serves.

## Layout
Because all the projects are similar, yet distinct enough to warrant multiple repositories, digitalFootprint will be making use of Git's --orphan flag. This essentially allows for multiple branches to be treated similarly to the master branch. Each sudo-master branch acts as a distinct project with a separate tracking and commit history. Despite having multiple projects in one repository, merge requests can still be optimized seamlessly by tweaking Github settings. Master will continue to hold the website, https://kaelanwillauer.github.io/digitalFootprint/, and documentation for each branch will be stored respectively. Updated: https://www.digitalfootprint.ga/
